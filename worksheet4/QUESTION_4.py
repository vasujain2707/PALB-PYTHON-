QUES-You are given a 0-indexed array of integers nums of length n. You are initially 
positioned at index 0.
Each element nums[i] represents the maximum length of a forward jump from index i. 
In other words, if you are at index i, you can jump to any index (i + j) where:
• 0 <= j <= nums[i] and
• i + j < n
Return the minimum number of jumps to reach index n - 1. The test cases are generated 
such that you can reach index n - 1.

class Solution:
    def jump(self, nums):
        
        jumps = 0
        current_end = 0
        farthest = 0
        
        for i in range(len(nums) - 1):
            
            farthest = max(farthest, i + nums[i])
            
            if i == current_end:
                jumps += 1
                current_end = farthest
        
        return jumps
