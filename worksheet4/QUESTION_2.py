QUES-Given an array of distinct integers candidates and a target integer target, return a list of 
all unique combinations of candidates where the chosen numbers sum to target. You 
may return the combinations in any order.
The same number may be chosen from candidates an unlimited number of times. 
Two combinations are unique if the frequency of at least one of the chosen numbers is 
different.
The test cases are generated such that the number of unique combinations that sum up 
to target is less than 150 combinations for the given input.

class Solution:
    def combinationSum(self, candidates, target):
        
        result = []
        
        def backtrack(start, current, remaining):
            
            if remaining == 0:
                result.append(current[:])   # copy list
                return
            
            if remaining < 0:
                return
            
            for i in range(start, len(candidates)):
                current.append(candidates[i])
                backtrack(i, current, remaining - candidates[i])  
                current.pop()  # backtrack
        
        backtrack(0, [], target)
        return result
