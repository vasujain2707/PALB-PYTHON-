QUES -  You are given two arrays a[] and b[], return the Union of both the arrays in any 
order. 
The Union of two arrays is a collection of all distinct elements present in either of 
the arrays. If an element appears more than once in one or both arrays, it should be 
included only once in the result. 

class Solution:
    def findUnion(self, a, b):
        return list(set(a) | set(b))
