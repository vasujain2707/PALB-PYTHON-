QUES- Given an array of intervals where intervals[i] = [starti, endi], merge all 
overlapping intervals, and return an array of the non-overlapping intervals that 
cover all the intervals in the input.

class Solution:
    def merge(self, intervals):
        # Step 1: Sort by start time
        intervals.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])
        
        merged = []
        
        for interval in intervals:
            
            # If merged is empty OR no overlap
            if not merged or merged[-1][1] < interval[0]:
                merged.append(interval)
            
            # If overlap → merge
            else:
                merged[-1][1] = max(merged[-1][1], interval[1])
        
        return merged
