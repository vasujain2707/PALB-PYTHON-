QUES-You are given a 2D binary array arr[][] consisting of only 1s and 0s. Each row of the 
array is sorted in non-decreasing order. Your task is to find and return the index of the 
first row that contains the maximum number of 1s. If no such row exists, return -1.
Note:
• The array follows 0-based indexing.
• The number of rows and columns in the array are denoted 
by n and m respectively.

class Solution:
    def rowWithMax1s(self, arr):
        
        n = len(arr)
        m = len(arr[0])
        
        row = 0
        col = m - 1
        max_row_index = -1
        
        while row < n and col >= 0:
            
            if arr[row][col] == 1:
                max_row_index = row
                col -= 1
            else:
                row += 1
        
        return max_row_index
